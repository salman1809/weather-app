   - Humidity levels
   - Wind speed and direction
   - Precipitation (rain, snow, etc.)
   - Atmospheric pressure
   - UV index

2. **Forecast**:
   - Hourly or daily weather forecasts
   - Temperature highs and lows
   - Chance of rain or snow
   - Wind forecast
   - Sunrise and sunset times

3. **Alerts and Warnings**:
   - Severe weather alerts (e.g., thunderstorms, hurricanes, blizzards)
   - Localized weather warnings

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Weather maps (e.g., radar or satellite imagery)
   - Air quality index
   - Visibility levels
   - Integration with smart home devices (e.g., smart thermostats)
   - Customizable notifications based on weather conditions

5. **Location Services**:
   - GPS-based location to automatically show weather for the user's current location
   - The ability to add multiple locations to track weather in various cities or regions.

Weather apps can be designed for smartphones, tablets, or websites, and they might include personalized recommendations (like suggesting what to wear based on weather conditions). Some apps even provide long-term climate patterns and insights.
